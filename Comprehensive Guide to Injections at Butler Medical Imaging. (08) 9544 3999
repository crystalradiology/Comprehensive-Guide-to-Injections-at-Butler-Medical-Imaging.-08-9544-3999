What is an Injection?
An injection, particularly in the context of interventional radiology, is a procedure where a specialist uses imaging technology such as a CT scanner or an ultrasound machine to guide a needle or catheter to a specific location in the body. This technique is employed to treat various conditions, often for the purpose of pain relief, delivering medication directly to a targeted area, or performing biopsies.
What Happens During My Injection?
When you arrive for your injection procedure at Butler Medical Imaging, the process is straightforward and designed for your comfort:
	Positioning: Depending on the area of the body being treated, you will either sit or lie down. The specialist will position you to ensure the best access to the injection site.
	Imaging Guidance: Using real-time imaging from a CT scanner or ultrasound machine, the specialist will locate the exact area that requires treatment.
	Needle Insertion: The needle or catheter is carefully guided to the precise location through a small puncture in the skin. It's crucial to remain as still as possible during this step to ensure accuracy.
	Injection: Once the needle is in place, the medication is injected, or the biopsy is performed.
Types of Injections
Butler Medical Imaging offers a range of interventional injections to address different medical needs:
1.	Ultrasound-Guided Injections: Commonly used for the shoulder, elbow, and knee. These injections are precise and can effectively deliver medication to reduce inflammation and pain.
2.	CT-Guided Injections: These include nerve injections (Periradicular), epidural injections, and facet joint injections, often used for pain management in the spine and other areas.

How Long Will It Take?
CT-Guided Injections: These typically take about 10-20 minutes from start to finish, depending on the complexity of the procedure.
Ultrasound-Guided Injections: These can take approximately 5-10 minutes, again depending on the specific area being treated.
